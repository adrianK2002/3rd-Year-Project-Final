	<h1 style="color: black">What is progressive overload?</h1>
	<p>Progressive overload is when you gradually increase the weight, frequency, or number of repetitions in your strength training routine.
	This challenges your body and allows your musculoskeletal system to get stronger.
	Although progressive overload is usually used in strength training, the same 
	idea can be applied to any type of exercise, including cardiovascular endurance exercises like running.
	By changing up your workouts and adding additional tension to your muscles, 
	you can avoid plateauing, which is when your body adapts to the type of exercise youâ€™re doing. 
	With progressive overload, you may notice you feel fitter and stronger.</p>
